<h1 id="hagl-haskell-game-language">Hagl: Haskell Game Language</h1>
<p><p>A DSL embedded in Haskell for <em>experimental/evolutionary game theory</em>. Hagl
supports defining a wide variety of games and strategies, then executing them
repeatedly in order to collect and observe the results.</p>
<p>Hagl provides built-in support for standard game representations, such as
normal and extensive form, and constructs for defining games in terms of the
manipulation of a shared state (as in tic-tac-toe). More exotic game
representations can be added by instantiating a type class.</p>
<p>A monadic sub-DSL supports concise and vaguely English-like definitions of
strategies for playing these games, usually iteratively.</p>
<p>While Hagl provides some basic game analyses, its primary focus is on
simulation and experimentation. Games can be executed and strategies can be
pitted against each other for repeated play and in various tournament formats.</p></p>

players, and strategies—in experiments and simulations. It is often used in
cases where traditional, analytical game theory fails or is difficult to apply.
This thesis collects three previously published papers that provide
domain-specific language (DSL) support for defining and executing these
experiments, and for explaining their results.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread use of software in this field, there is a distinct lack
of tool support for common tasks like modeling games and running simulations.
Instead, most experiments are created from scratch in general-purpose
programming languages. We have addressed this problem with Hagl, a DSL embedded
in Haskell that allows the concise, declarative definition of games,
strategies, and executable experiments. Hagl raises the level of abstraction
for experimental game theory, reducing the effort to conduct experiments and
freeing experimenters to focus on hard problems in their domain instead of
low-level implementation details.</p>
<p>While analytical game theory is most often used as a prescriptive tool, a way
to analyze a situation and determine the best course of action, experimental
game theory is often applied descriptively to explain why agents interact and
behave in a certain way. Often these interactions are complex and surprising.
To support this explanatory role, we have designed visual DSL for explaining
the interaction of strategies for iterated games. This language is used as a
vehicle to introduce the notational quality of traceability and the new
paradigm of explanation-oriented programming.</p></div></div></li>

fields, providing insight into strategic behavior through simulation and
experimentation on game theoretic models. Unfortunately, despite relying
heavily on automation, this approach has not been well supported by tools. Here
we present our continuing work on Hagl, a domain-specific language embedded in
Haskell, intended to drastically reduce the development time of such
experiments and support a highly explorative research style. In this paper we
present a fundamental redesign of the underlying game representation in Hagl.
These changes allow us to better leverage domain knowledge by allowing
different classes of games to be represented differently, exploiting existing
domain representations and algorithms. In particular, we show how this supports
analytical extensions to Hagl, and makes strategies for state-based games
vastly simpler and more efficient.</p></div></div></li>

applications in economics, social sciences, and in general science education.
This language facilitates explanations of strategies by visually representing
the interaction of players’ strategies with game execution. We have utilized
the cognitive dimensions framework in the design phase and recognized the need
for a new cognitive dimension of “traceability” that considers how well a
language can represent the execution of a program. We consider how traceability
interacts with other cognitive dimensions and demonstrate its use in analyzing
existing languages. We conclude that the design of a visual representation for
execution traces should be an integral part of the design of visual languages
because understanding a program is often tightly coupled to its execution.</p></div></div></li>
